            <div className="message">Sequoia is very symbolic for our project because it is the tallest tree on the planet. The sequoia is rightfully considered a giant among the vast number of trees growing on Earth. It grows, despite any obstacles. Only gravity can hold back its development. In addition, the bark of the Sequoia is saturated with moisture, which acts as a good defense during forest fires. Like Sequoia, the Seqchain team is committed to continuous development and significant benefits to the environment and community, collaborating with us to develop and launch new large-scale projects.</div>
